# # Tic-tac-toe game
from Wikipedia: 
*Is a paper-and-pencil game (in our case it is in web app), for two 
players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.*
